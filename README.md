# frankenstatus
 Implementation of Bainbridge's STATUS simulation written for Python

#To Run:
python frankenstatus.py

1. Input number of "guests" to be invited to Frankenstatus' commune (e.g. 46)
2. Read initial distribution of traits and names. 
3. Input desired correlation threshold (e.g. -0.50)
4. Input desired number of swaps (e.g. 20000)
5. Watch as the mad scientist uses the psychexchanger and new correlations are developed.
6. Compare new results with initial ones.

This program is adapted from the 'STATUS' exercise in SOCIOLOGY LABORATORY written by William Sims Bainbridge and published in 1987. The book consists of twelve exercises designed to teach students about sociological concepts and theories and develop sociological reasoning. Originally, this version of the book shipped with either a 5.25" or 3.5" floppy disk for IBM PC/IBM-compatibles or Apple computers. 

Though the software medium itself would prove difficult to implement in a classroom, I don't believe the exercise itself would be. By updating the program to be written in a contemporary programming language (in this case, Python), sociology teachers can continue to use these exercises in their classroooms and provide a deeper level of engagement (not to mention fun) in their lessons.
