***THE COMMUNE OF DR. FRANKENSTATUS***
"Dr. Victor Frankenstatus, polymath without peer, has found the answer to achieving equality.People enter a utipoian commune with a range of characteristics that give them more or less power in their dealings with each other.
Only by equalizing these characteristics, Frankenstatus believes, can true, lasting equality be achieved. The solution is a marvelous new machine Frankenstatus invented, the "psychexchanger." It is quite a large device, a room full of pipes, motors, lenses, and electrical circuits.At the business end are two seats. 
Take two people, Jack and Jill for instance. Sit them down and strap them in. Place the psychexchanger helmets over their heads.
Push the START button.... and ZAP! In an instant, Jack and Jill switch minds!
The Doctor knows some people have quick minds (bright people). The Doctor knows that some people are considered especially attractive (beautiful people). The Doctor is going to switch enough minds until the bright people are all less attractive....
and the beautiful people are all dim." Thus, power differentials are eliminated.
This is bologna, you know, but that doesn't stop Dr. Frankenstatus, and you're paid to be his RA.
